# Deep_Neural_Networks_with_PyTorch
This repository contains code and resources for learning how to build deep neural networks with PyTorch.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
PyTorch 1.0 or higher
NumPy
Matplotlib
Installation
To install PyTorch, follow the instructions on the official PyTorch website.

To install the other dependencies, you can use pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib
Usage
The repository contains several Python scripts, each of which demonstrates a different aspect of building deep neural networks with PyTorch. To run a script, navigate to the repository's root directory and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python <script_name>.py
Replace <script_name> with the name of the script you want to run.
