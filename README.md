# Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch

This repository contains resources, tutorials, and code for learning how to build deep neural networks using PyTorch.

# Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 1.0 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib


## Installation

You can install PyTorch by following the instructions given in the
[official PyTorch website.](https://pytorch.org/)

You can install NumPy and Matplotlib by running the following command:


```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
## Usage

The repository includes multiple Python scripts, each one covering different concepts of building deep neural networks with PyTorch. To execute a script, navigate to the repository's root directory and run the following command:


```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

Replace **`<script_name>`** 
with the name of the script you want to run.
